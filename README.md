# Laschisa Financial

**Laschisa Financial** is a project developed in React, styled with **Styled-Components**, using **Vite** as the bundler, and **TypeScript** for static typing. This project was highly productive for my learning in several areas of modern front-end development:

- I deepened my understanding of managing component state and building responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
- I learned how to optimize application performance using **Vite**, ensuring fast and efficient builds.
- I had the opportunity to integrate libraries such as **Axios** and **MirageJS**, which improved my grasp of asynchronous operations and testing with mock data.
- It strengthened my use of best practices in **clean code**, modularity, and maintaining medium to large-scale projects.
- Static typing with **TypeScript** helped me prevent errors and make the code more secure and predictable.
